Vision statements undergo minimal revisions during the life of a program, unlike operational goals and objectives which may be updated from year-to-year. Effective vision statements are clear, concise and usually consist of two to four sentences. Vision statements should provide a high-level description of the program outcomes required to meet the definition of success.\n\n#### Commonly cited vision statement traits include:\n- concise: able to be easily remembered and repeated\n- clear: defines a prime goal\n- Time horizon: defines a time horizon\n- future-oriented: describes where the company is going rather than the current state\n- stable: offers a long-term perspective and is unlikely to be impacted by market or technology changes\n- challenging: not something that can be easily met and discarded\n- abstract: general enough to encompass all of the organization's interests and strategic direction\n- inspiring: motivates employees and is something that employees view as desirable\n","created_at":"2018-02-25T21:58:01.616Z","updated_at":"2018-02-25T22:05:37.729Z","url":"http://localhost/workflow_steps/1.json","knowledge_articles":[{"id":1,"title":"How to Create a
